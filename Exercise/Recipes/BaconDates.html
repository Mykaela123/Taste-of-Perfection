        <h2><u>Directions</u></h2>

        <p><b>STEP 1:</b></p>
        <p>Preheat your oven to 190°C.</p>
        <P><b>STEP 2:</b></P>
        <p>Make a small slit in each date to create an opening for stuffing. Be careful not to cut the date in half completely.</p>
        <p><b>STEP 3:</b></p>
        <P>Take a whole almond and stuff it into the opening of each date. Then, use a small spoon or a piping bag to fill the dates with cream cheese. You can also mix the almond and cream cheese together before stuffing if you prefer.</P>
        <p><b>STEP 4:</b></p>
        <p>Take a half-slice of bacon and wrap it around each stuffed date, securing it with a toothpick. Make sure to wrap the bacon tightly around the date.</p>
        <p><b>STEP 5:</b></p>
        <p> Place the bacon-wrapped dates on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a wire rack placed on top of a baking sheet. This will allow excess grease to drip away during baking</p>
        <p><b>STEP 6:</b></p>
        <p> Bake the dates in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes or until the bacon is crispy and cooked to your liking. Keep an eye on them to prevent overcooking.</p>
        <p><b>STEP 7:</b></p>
        <p>Allow the bacon-wrapped dates to cool slightly before serving. The cream cheese filling will be hot, so be cautious when taking a bite. Serve them as a tasty appetizer for your guests to enjoy.</p>

        <h2><u>Cooking Tips and Tricks:</u></h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p><u><b>Use Fresh and Plump Dates:</b></u>Choose fresh and plump Medjool dates for the best flavor and texture. They should be soft and slightly sticky to the touch.</p></li>
            <li><p><u><b>Pit the Dates Carefully:</b></u>When making the slit in the dates to remove the pits, be gentle to avoid splitting them in half completely. You want to create a pocket for the filling.</p></li>
            <li><p><u><b>Soak Toothpicks:</b></u>If you're using wooden toothpicks, consider soaking them in water for about 15-30 minutes before using. This helps prevent them from burning in the oven.</p></li>
            <li><p><u><b>Secure the Bacon Well:</b></u> Ensure that the bacon is tightly wrapped around each date and secured with a toothpick. This prevents the bacon from unraveling during cooking.</p></li>
            <li><p><u><b>Partial Pre-cook the Bacon:</b></u> If you prefer crispier bacon, you can partially pre-cook it in the oven for a few minutes before wrapping the dates. This helps ensure that the bacon gets crispy without overcooking the dates.</p></li>
            <li><p><u><b>Experiment with Fillings:</b></u>Get creative with the fillings. While cream cheese and almonds are classic choices, you can try other ingredients like blue cheese, pecans, or even jalapeño slices for a spicy kick.</p></li>
            <li><p><u><b>Rack or Parchment Paper:</b></u> Placing the wrapped dates on a wire rack over a baking sheet or using parchment paper helps elevate them, allowing excess grease to drip away, resulting in crispier bacon.</p></li>
            <li><p><u><b>Monitor Cooking Time:</b></u>Keep a close eye on the dates while they're in the oven to prevent overcooking. Bacon can go from undercooked to overcooked quickly, so adjust the cooking time as needed.</p></li>
            <li><p><u><b>Pairing Suggestions: </b></u>Consider serving these bacon-wrapped dates with a drizzle of honey or a balsamic reduction for an extra burst of flavor.</p></li>
